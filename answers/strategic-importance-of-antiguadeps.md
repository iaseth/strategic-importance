Antigua and Barbuda, not Antigua & Deps,  is a small island nation in the Caribbean, and while it has friendly relations with India, it doesn't hold significant strategic importance for India in the way larger nations like the US or China might. Here's why:

* **Limited Economic Ties:**  The economic relationship between India and Antigua and Barbuda is relatively minor. India's trade with the Caribbean nation is limited, and there's not a large Indian diaspora in Antigua and Barbuda like there is in some other parts of the world.
* **Geopolitical Significance:** Antigua and Barbuda's strategic importance is primarily related to its location in the Caribbean, which is of interest to major powers like the US and the UK due to its proximity to the Panama Canal and other key shipping lanes. However, India's geopolitical interests are focused on the Indo-Pacific region.
* **Military Presence:** India does not have a significant military presence in the Caribbean. The Indian Navy, while occasionally engaging in goodwill visits to various parts of the world, does not have a regular presence in the region.
* **Political Alignments:**  Antigua and Barbuda's foreign policy is largely shaped by its historical ties to the UK and its close relationship with the US. While India has good relations with the country, it doesn't hold a major position in their foreign policy alignments.
* **Limited Resource Potential:**  Antigua and Barbuda is a small island nation with limited natural resources and economic potential. This limits its overall importance as a strategic partner for any country. 

While Antigua and Barbuda is a valuable ally and partner to India, it doesn't carry the same strategic weight as other nations in the Indo-Pacific region, which are central to India's foreign policy objectives.
