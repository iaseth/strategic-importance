India and Brazil have signed several agreements for cooperation in areas like joint training, technology transfer, and military exercises. This collaborative approach enhances mutual security and strengthens their defense postures.

India's ISRO and Brazil's INPE have established a partnership for collaborative projects in satellite development and launch, Earth observation, and space science. These collaborations provide opportunities for technological advancements and foster scientific innovation.

5. **Cultural and People-to-People Exchange:** India and Brazil share a long history of cultural exchange, with both nations having significant diaspora communities in each other's countries.
