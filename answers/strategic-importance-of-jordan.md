Jordan is a significant trading partner for India, with increasing trade in pharmaceuticals, textiles, and agricultural products. India also sees potential for investment in Jordanian infrastructure and energy sectors.

4. **Defense and Security Cooperation:** India and Jordan have strong defense ties, engaging in joint military exercises and exchanging knowledge.  This cooperation enhances both countries' security capabilities and contributes to regional stability.
