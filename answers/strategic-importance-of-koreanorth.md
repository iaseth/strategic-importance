It's important to understand that **North Korea is not strategically important to India in a way that would justify close relations.**  While there are some historical and economic connections, the current political and security situation makes it unlikely for North Korea to play a significant role in India's strategic interests. 

Here's why:

1. **North Korea's Isolated and Authoritarian Regime:** North Korea's political system and human rights record are incompatible with India's democratic values. This makes cooperation and strategic engagement highly problematic. 
2. **Nuclear Proliferation Concerns:** North Korea's nuclear weapons program and ballistic missile development pose a threat to regional security, and India, as a responsible nuclear power, opposes such activities.
3. **Limited Economic Opportunities:** North Korea's economy is underdeveloped and closed, offering minimal opportunities for trade or investment.  This makes economic engagement with North Korea unattractive for India.
4. **China's Dominant Influence:** North Korea is heavily dependent on China economically and politically. This limits India's ability to influence North Korean policies or build a meaningful strategic partnership.
5. **Security Concerns:** India's strategic interests are heavily focused on its neighborhood, particularly Pakistan and China. North Korea does not pose a direct security threat to India, and its involvement in regional security issues is limited.

In conclusion, while there may be historical connections and potential for limited cooperation in specific areas, **North Korea is not strategically important to India in a significant way.** India's primary strategic interests lie in its immediate neighborhood and maintaining a strong relationship with key partners like the United States, Japan, and South Korea.
