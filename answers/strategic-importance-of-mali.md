While Mali does not have a particularly strong strategic relationship with India, there are some potential reasons why it could be considered strategically important:

1. **Resource Potential:** Mali is rich in natural resources, including gold, uranium, and lithium. India has a growing demand for these resources, and Mali could potentially be a supplier.  However, the ongoing political instability in Mali complicates any potential resource extraction.
2. **Counter-Terrorism:** Mali has been battling a long-running insurgency in the north, which has spilled over into neighboring countries. India has been active in countering terrorism globally, and could potentially offer assistance to Mali in this area. 
3. **Trade and Investment:** While trade between India and Mali is currently limited, there is potential for increased economic cooperation. India could invest in Mali's infrastructure and industry, which could benefit both countries.
4. **Military Cooperation:** India has a long history of providing military assistance to African countries.  India could potentially offer training and equipment to the Malian military, which could contribute to stability in the region. However, this would likely be limited due to Mali's current political turmoil.
5. **Diplomacy and Global Cooperation:** India is a member of the G20 and the UN Security Council, and has a strong commitment to multilateralism. India could leverage its influence to promote stability and peace in Mali, particularly through international organizations.

However, it's crucial to note that:

* **Political Instability:** The ongoing political crisis and the presence of terrorist groups in Mali pose significant risks to any potential strategic relationship.
* **Limited Engagement:**  India's current engagement with Mali is relatively limited, primarily focused on development assistance.
* **Other Priorities:** India has other, more strategically important partners in Africa, such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya.

Therefore, while Mali holds some potential for strategic importance to India, it is not considered a high priority at this time.
