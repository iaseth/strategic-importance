While Niger is not typically considered a top-tier strategic partner for India, there are some potential areas of interest and cooperation that could develop:

1. **Mineral Resources:** Niger possesses significant reserves of uranium, a vital resource for India's nuclear power program. Secure access to uranium supply chains is crucial for India's energy independence and ambitions to increase nuclear power generation. 

2. **Counterterrorism Cooperation:** Niger faces security challenges from various terrorist groups operating in the Sahel region. India, with its experience in counterterrorism operations and intelligence sharing, could potentially offer technical expertise and training to Nigerien security forces, contributing to regional stability.

3. **Developmental Assistance:** India has a history of providing development assistance to African countries. Niger, being one of the poorest countries in the world, could benefit from Indian assistance in areas like infrastructure development, agriculture, healthcare, and education. This could help strengthen India's diplomatic presence in the region.

4. **Strategic Partnerships with Other Players:** India's growing partnerships with other countries in the Sahel region, like France and the United States, could indirectly benefit Niger. India could leverage these partnerships to strengthen ties with Niger and promote joint initiatives in areas of mutual interest.

5. **Potential for Investment:** While limited currently, Niger could present opportunities for Indian investments in sectors like agriculture, mining, and renewable energy. This could lead to economic growth and development in Niger, further fostering bilateral relations.

It is important to note that these are potential areas of cooperation and not necessarily existing strong ties. India's strategic focus in Africa remains primarily on countries with larger populations, more economic heft, and greater geopolitical influence. However, Niger's potential resources and strategic location could eventually lead to stronger bilateral relations between the two countries.
