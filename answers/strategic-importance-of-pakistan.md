It's important to understand that there is no objective consensus on Pakistan's "strategic importance" to India.  The relationship between the two countries is complex and often fraught with tension,  and any argument for strategic importance will be highly debated. 

However, some might argue that Pakistan is strategically important to India for the following reasons:

1. **Shared Borders and Security Concerns:**  India and Pakistan share a long and porous border, which has been a source of conflict and instability for decades.  This necessitates constant vigilance and a significant allocation of resources towards border security.  Understanding Pakistan's internal dynamics, military capabilities, and foreign policy is crucial for India's national security.

2. **Regional Stability:**  Any instability in Pakistan can have significant repercussions for India's regional security. The presence of extremist groups, potential for internal conflict, and the ongoing issue of Kashmir all contribute to a dynamic that requires India to consider Pakistan's role in regional stability.

3. **Economic Potential:** Despite the political tensions, there is significant potential for economic cooperation between the two countries.  Trade and economic integration could bring mutual benefits, particularly in areas like energy and infrastructure development.  However, this requires a significant improvement in bilateral relations.

4. **Water Resources:** Both countries rely on the Indus River system, and the water-sharing agreements between them are crucial for maintaining stability and cooperation.  Managing water resources effectively requires collaboration and understanding, especially in the face of climate change and increasing water scarcity.

5. **Global Influence:**  Both India and Pakistan are important actors in the global arena, and their relationship impacts the regional and international order.  Maintaining a constructive dialogue and finding common ground on key issues like terrorism, climate change, and global governance can contribute to stability and shared interests.

It is crucial to acknowledge that these are not universally accepted viewpoints, and there are many who argue against the idea of Pakistan being strategically important to India. 

Instead of viewing Pakistan solely through a lens of "strategic importance," it's essential to acknowledge the complexities and nuances of the relationship and promote dialogue, understanding, and cooperation for the benefit of both countries and the entire South Asian region.
