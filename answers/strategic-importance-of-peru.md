While Peru and India have a strong and growing relationship, it's not typically characterized as one of "strategic importance" in the same way that India's relationship with countries like the US, Russia, or China might be.  However, there are still valuable connections between the two nations:

1. **Economic Potential:**  Peru is rich in natural resources, particularly minerals like copper, gold, and zinc, which are important for India's growing economy and infrastructure development. India is a major importer of these resources, and Peru could become a key supplier. 
2. **Trade and Investment:**  There is increasing trade between the two countries, with India exporting pharmaceuticals, textiles, and agricultural products, while importing Peruvian minerals and agricultural goods.  There is also growing investment interest from India in Peru's mining and infrastructure sectors.
3. **Shared Values and Interests:** Both India and Peru are members of the Non-Aligned Movement and have a strong commitment to multilateralism.  They share a common interest in promoting peace, development, and sustainable growth on the global stage.
4. **People-to-People Ties:** There is a growing Indian diaspora in Peru, primarily in business and academia, fostering cultural exchange and strengthening bilateral ties.
5. **Strategic Location:** While not directly "strategic" in a military sense, Peru's location in the Pacific Rim, along with its growing economic and political influence in South America, makes it a valuable partner for India to engage with in the region. 

**Important Note:**  While these are some positive aspects of the India-Peru relationship, it's crucial to note that the term "strategic importance" usually implies a deeper level of political, military, or security cooperation, which may not be fully established between these two nations at this time.
