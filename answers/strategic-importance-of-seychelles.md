Here are 5 reasons why Seychelles is of strategic importance to India:

1. **Security and Maritime Interests:** Seychelles sits in a crucial location in the Indian Ocean, close to major shipping lanes and important chokepoints. This location makes it strategically vital for India's security and maritime interests. India is concerned about piracy, terrorism, and other security threats in the region, and having a strong presence in Seychelles helps them to monitor and respond to these issues.

2. **Counterbalancing China's Influence:** China has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean region, including investing heavily in infrastructure projects in Seychelles. India sees Seychelles as a key partner in counterbalancing China's growing influence in the region. By strengthening its relationship with Seychelles, India aims to ensure that its own interests are not overshadowed by China's.

3. **Economic Ties and Investments:** Seychelles is a significant trading partner for India, with India being a major source of investment in the country. India has invested in various sectors in Seychelles, including infrastructure, tourism, and fisheries. By strengthening its economic ties with Seychelles, India can secure access to resources and markets, while also supporting the country's economic development.

4. **Defense Cooperation and Military Base Access:** India and Seychelles have a strong defense cooperation agreement, which includes joint naval exercises, training, and information sharing. India has also been granted access to facilities in Seychelles, including a military base on Assumption Island. These arrangements allow India to project its military power in the region and respond to any potential security threats.

5. **Diplomatic Influence and Regional Stability:** Seychelles is a vocal supporter of India in international forums, and the two countries share close diplomatic ties. India views Seychelles as a valuable partner in promoting regional stability and cooperation in the Indian Ocean. Through its partnership with Seychelles, India can exert its diplomatic influence and help to shape the regional security environment.
