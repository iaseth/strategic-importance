It's difficult to argue that Swaziland, now known as Eswatini, holds significant strategic importance for India. While there are some areas of cooperation, they don't reach the level of "strategic importance." Here's why:

1. **Limited Economic Ties:** Eswatini's economy is small and reliant on South Africa. India's trade and investment interests in the region are primarily focused on larger economies like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. 
2. **No Geopolitical Significance:** Eswatini doesn't play a major role in regional or global politics. India's foreign policy strategy prioritizes engaging with key players in areas like the Indian Ocean region, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.
3. **Limited Diplomatic Presence:**  India maintains a High Commission in Pretoria, South Africa, which also covers Eswatini.  There's no dedicated diplomatic presence in Eswatini, reflecting the limited scale of bilateral relations.
4. **No Major Security Concerns:**  India's security interests are primarily focused on managing its own borders, maintaining regional stability in South Asia, and addressing threats from terrorism.  Eswatini doesn't pose any significant security threats to India.
5. **No Strong Historical Ties:**  India and Eswatini have limited historical ties.  The primary focus of Indian foreign policy historically has been on building relationships with other countries that share similar historical experiences, cultural ties, or political ideologies.

**Areas of Cooperation:**

Despite the lack of strategic importance, there are areas of cooperation between India and Eswatini, mainly focused on:

* **Development Assistance:** India provides development assistance to Eswatini through programs focused on education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
* **Cultural Exchange:** Both countries participate in cultural exchange programs and festivals. 
* **Technical Cooperation:** India offers technical training and expertise in areas such as agriculture and technology.

In summary, while there are some areas of cooperation, Eswatini's limited economic size, lack of geopolitical significance, and absence of strong historical or security ties make it unlikely to be considered strategically important for India.
