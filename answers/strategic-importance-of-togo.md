It's difficult to definitively state that Togo holds a specific "strategic importance" for India in the way that, say, a major military ally might. However, there are certain factors that suggest potential areas of cooperation and interest between the two nations:

1. **Economic Partnerships:** India has a growing interest in expanding trade relations in Africa. Togo, with its strategic location on the Gulf of Guinea, could serve as a potential gateway to other West African markets. India could potentially invest in Togo's infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors, creating mutually beneficial economic opportunities.

2. **Maritime Security:** Togo's coastline faces the Gulf of Guinea, a region prone to piracy and other maritime security threats. India, with its expanding naval presence and growing interest in ensuring maritime security in the Indian Ocean, might see potential for collaboration with Togo in combating these threats. This could involve sharing information, joint patrols, and capacity building programs.

3. **Development Cooperation:** India has been actively involved in development assistance programs across Africa. Togo, being a developing nation, could benefit from Indian expertise and resources in areas like healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. This could further strengthen bilateral ties.

4. **Diplomatic Relations:** India and Togo maintain good diplomatic relations, with both nations emphasizing their commitment to South-South cooperation. This provides a foundation for further strengthening bilateral ties and exploring opportunities for collaboration in various sectors.

5. **Resource Potential:** Togo possesses a range of natural resources, including phosphates, manganese, and limestone. India, with its growing demand for raw materials, could be interested in exploring potential partnerships for resource extraction and utilization. 

**Overall, while Togo may not be a central element of India's strategic interests, there are potential areas for cooperation and engagement that could benefit both nations.** It's important to note that these are potential areas of interest, and the extent of their actual impact on the relationship between India and Togo will depend on future developments and political decisions.
