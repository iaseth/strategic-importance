It's important to note that while Ukraine holds some strategic importance for India, it's not a top-tier priority compared to other countries in India's foreign policy. Here are 5 reasons why Ukraine is of some strategic importance to India:

1. **Access to Black Sea Region and Eurasian Trade:** Ukraine's strategic location on the Black Sea gives India potential access to the region, including important trade routes and markets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. While currently disrupted by the ongoing conflict, this could be a significant economic opportunity in the future.
2. **Military Cooperation and Arms Trade:** India has a history of military cooperation with Ukraine, including the purchase of weapons and technology. This relationship, while less significant than other partnerships, could potentially be revived and strengthened in the future.
3. **Shared Concerns About Terrorism and Extremism:** Both India and Ukraine have faced threats from terrorism and extremism, particularly in the context of separatist movements and conflicts. This shared experience could lead to increased cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts and intelligence sharing.
4. **Support for a Multipolar World Order:** Both India and Ukraine are proponents of a multipolar world order, opposed to the dominance of a single superpower. This shared vision could lead to closer collaboration on international issues, particularly in organizations like the UN.
5. **Growing Economic Ties:** India and Ukraine have been increasing economic ties in recent years, including trade in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and IT services. This potential for economic cooperation could strengthen the bilateral relationship in the future. 

It's crucial to acknowledge that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine significantly complicates the relationship between the two countries. India's policy towards Ukraine has been marked by neutrality, with a focus on humanitarian aid and promoting peace. However, the potential for stronger ties in the future exists once the conflict is resolved.
