While Uruguay may not be the first country that comes to mind when considering India's strategic partnerships, there are some reasons why it could be of interest:

1. **Potential for Agricultural Collaboration:** Uruguay is a significant agricultural producer, particularly in beef and dairy, sectors where India has growing demand. Collaborating on technology transfer, trade, and investment in these areas could be mutually beneficial. 

2. **Beef Market Access:** India is a large and growing beef market, and Uruguay is a major exporter. India's current beef import policies are restrictive, but Uruguay could be a potential source for halal beef, potentially opening up a new trade channel.

3. **Renewable Energy and Climate Change:** Both countries are committed to renewable energy and combating climate change. Uruguay is a leader in wind and solar power, and India could benefit from their expertise and technology in this field. 

4. **Regional Hub for South American Trade:** Uruguay is a member of MERCOSUR, a large South American trade bloc. This could provide India with access to the wider South American market through Uruguay as a gateway.

5. **Diplomatic Relations and Political Alignment:**  Uruguay has consistently supported India's position on international issues, particularly within the UN. Strengthening diplomatic ties could lead to further cooperation on global issues of mutual interest.

**However, it's important to note that:**

* These reasons are largely potential opportunities, not yet fully realized collaborations. 
* The strategic importance of Uruguay for India is relatively limited compared to other countries in the region like Brazil or Argentina. 
* The economic and political landscape is constantly evolving, and these factors could change over time. 

Therefore, while Uruguay holds some potential for strategic partnerships, it's important to weigh these possibilities against the overall context of India's foreign policy and global priorities.
