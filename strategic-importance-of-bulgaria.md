It's difficult to argue that Bulgaria has a **direct** strategic importance to India in the same way that countries like the US or Russia might.  However, there are some **indirect** reasons why Bulgaria could be of interest to India:

1. **EU Membership and Trade Access:** Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, which is India's largest trading partner.  Therefore, fostering good relations with Bulgaria can help India navigate EU trade policies and secure better access to the European market.
2. **Potential for Investment:** Bulgaria offers potential for Indian investment in areas like IT, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. This could be mutually beneficial, providing opportunities for Indian businesses and contributing to Bulgaria's economic development.
3. **Cultural Exchange:** Both countries have a rich history and culture.  Enhancing cultural exchange programs can strengthen people-to-people ties, promoting understanding and cooperation between the two nations.
4. **Regional Cooperation:** India is increasingly engaging with the Balkan region. Bulgaria, as a key player in the region, could be a valuable partner for India in collaborating on initiatives related to security, trade, and development.
5. **Energy Cooperation:** Bulgaria, like India, is a significant importer of energy. Both countries could potentially collaborate on energy security initiatives, especially in areas like renewable energy development.

However, it's important to remember that these are **indirect** connections, and Bulgaria's strategic importance to India is not on par with other major global players.
