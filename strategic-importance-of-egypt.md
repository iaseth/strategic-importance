Here are 5 reasons why Egypt is of strategic importance to India:

1. **Geopolitical Location:** Egypt's strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe makes it a vital partner for India's "Act East" and "Neighborhood First" policies. Egypt's Suez Canal is a crucial trade route for India's exports and imports, connecting India to European markets and beyond. 

2. **Energy Security:**  Egypt possesses significant natural gas reserves, which can provide India with a reliable source of energy as it seeks to diversify its energy portfolio away from reliance on the Middle East. 

3. **Defence Cooperation:** Both countries have a growing defense partnership, including joint military exercises and technology sharing. Egypt's expertise in counter-terrorism and its military capabilities in the Red Sea region are valuable assets for India.  

4. **Economic Ties:**  India and Egypt are actively working to strengthen bilateral trade and investment.  India sees opportunities in Egypt's growing economy and its potential for infrastructure development, especially in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. 

5. **Cultural and Historical Ties:** Egypt and India share a rich history and cultural exchange dating back centuries.  This shared heritage fosters understanding and facilitates cooperation on various fronts. 

In summary, Egypt's strategic location, energy resources, defense cooperation, economic potential, and historical ties make it a key partner for India on the global stage.
