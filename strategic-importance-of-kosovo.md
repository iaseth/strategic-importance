It's difficult to argue that Kosovo holds significant strategic importance for India.  While Kosovo has seen increased economic activity and development, it lacks the geopolitical factors that would typically make a country strategically important for a large power like India. 

Here are some reasons why Kosovo's strategic importance to India is limited:

1. **Limited Economic Ties:** While India's economy is booming, its economic ties with Kosovo are relatively weak. There is no significant trade or investment between the two countries.
2. **Lack of Geopolitical Significance:** Kosovo is a small country in the Balkans, far removed from India's strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region and the Middle East. 
3. **Limited Diplomatic Relations:** India established diplomatic relations with Kosovo in 2019, but the relationship remains primarily at the level of exchanging ambassadors. There is no deep historical or cultural connection between the two countries.
4. **Focus on Regional Powers:** India's foreign policy priorities tend to focus on countries with significant geopolitical influence, such as the United States, China, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
5. **Challenges to Stability:** Kosovo's political and economic situation remains fragile. The country faces challenges with ethnic tensions, corruption, and economic instability. These factors make it unlikely to become a major strategic partner for India in the near future.

It's important to note that India's foreign policy is constantly evolving. However, based on current circumstances, Kosovo's strategic importance to India remains very limited.
