It's tricky to say Nauru holds significant strategic importance to India. While Nauru is a Pacific island nation, India's focus in the region is generally on its relations with larger countries like Australia, Japan, and Indonesia. There isn't much public information available about any specific strategic ties between India and Nauru.

However, let's explore some possible reasons why Nauru *could* be of *potential* strategic importance to India:

1. **Access to the Pacific:**  Nauru, like other Pacific island nations, could offer India a stepping stone to increase its presence and influence in the region. This could be especially important given China's growing influence in the Pacific. 
2. **Potential for resource extraction:** Nauru has phosphate resources, though currently depleted. If these resources were to be revisited, India could be interested in securing access.
3. **Naval base opportunity:** While highly unlikely, if India were to seek a naval base in the Pacific, Nauru's strategic location could be of interest.
4. **Diplomatic leverage:** Nauru's small size and reliance on foreign aid could make it a potential diplomatic ally for India. This could be useful for securing votes in international organizations or promoting specific policies.
5. **Climate Change Collaboration:**  Nauru is a low-lying island nation highly vulnerable to climate change. India, a major emitter, could potentially partner with Nauru on climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, building positive relations.

It's important to note that these are theoretical possibilities. India's strategic priorities in the Pacific are likely to focus on larger economies and geopolitical powerhouses, making Nauru's direct strategic importance relatively minor. However, Nauru could serve as a small but symbolic point of engagement for India in the region.
