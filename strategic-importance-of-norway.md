While Norway and India have strong diplomatic relations and growing cooperation in several areas, it's difficult to argue that Norway holds a **strategically crucial** position for India in the traditional sense. Here's why:

1. **Limited Geopolitical Overlap:** Norway is located in northern Europe, while India is in South Asia.  Their geographical distance and lack of immediate shared borders or security concerns limit their strategic interdependence.
2. **No Direct Military Alliance:** India and Norway do not have a formal military alliance, unlike India's relationships with countries like Russia or the US. 
3. **Limited Economic Interdependence:** While trade between the two countries exists, it is not significant enough to qualify as strategically important. The primary focus of India's economic partnerships is with countries in its immediate region and key global powers.
4. **No Critical Resources:** Norway is not a major supplier of any critical resources that India relies on. 
5. **Focus on Different Global Issues:** Norway's foreign policy priorities are heavily focused on Arctic issues, environmental concerns, and human rights, which, while important, are not central to India's immediate strategic priorities. 

**However, Norway is significant for India in these ways:**

* **Global Partnerships:** Norway is a strong supporter of multilateral organizations like the UN and participates actively in global forums where India also plays a leading role. 
* **Cooperation in Specific Areas:**  India and Norway cooperate in areas like renewable energy, climate change, and marine research, which are important to both countries.
* **Shared Values:** Both countries uphold democratic values, human rights, and rule of law, providing common ground for engagement.

In conclusion, while Norway may not be of "strategic importance" in the traditional geopolitical sense, it is a valuable partner for India on various fronts, contributing to shared goals and promoting cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
