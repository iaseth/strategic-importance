While Syria might not appear immediately important to India on the surface, there are some strategic considerations that make the country relevant to Indian interests:

1. **Energy Security:** Syria's geographic location gives it potential to play a role in energy corridors that could potentially link India to energy resources in the Caspian Sea region and Central Asia. This is significant for India, which relies heavily on imports for its energy needs. 

2. **Maritime Security:** India's strategic interests in the Middle East and beyond are closely tied to maritime security. Syria's coastline in the Eastern Mediterranean could play a role in securing India's sea lanes and preventing piracy or other threats. This is especially important for India's growing trade with the Middle East and Africa.

3. **Counterterrorism:**  Syria, despite its ongoing conflicts, can be a potential partner in fighting terrorism. Both India and Syria have faced challenges from extremist groups, and cooperation in counterterrorism efforts could be beneficial. However, this aspect is complicated by the ongoing civil war in Syria and its political instability.

4. **Diplomatic Influence:** Maintaining a relationship with Syria, even a limited one, provides India with a diplomatic presence in the Middle East. This can be beneficial in shaping regional diplomacy and navigating complex geopolitical situations. 

5. **Historical & Cultural Ties:** India has historical and cultural ties with Syria dating back centuries. This provides a foundation for potential cooperation in areas like cultural exchange, education, and tourism.

It's important to note that these strategic considerations are complex and subject to the ever-changing dynamics of the Middle East. The Syrian civil war and its aftermath have significantly impacted the country's political and economic situation, making it difficult to predict how these strategic interests will evolve in the future.
