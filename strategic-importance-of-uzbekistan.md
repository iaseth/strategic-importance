Here are 5 reasons why Uzbekistan is of strategic importance to India:

1. **Connectivity and Access to Central Asia:** Uzbekistan's strategic location in Central Asia makes it a vital hub for connectivity. India has long sought to enhance its access to the region, which offers vast potential for trade, investment, and cultural exchange. Uzbekistan provides a key gateway to markets like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, fostering economic growth and diversifying India's trade relations.
2. **Energy Security:** Uzbekistan is rich in natural resources, particularly natural gas. India, with its growing energy demands, sees Uzbekistan as a potential source of energy supplies.  This could help India reduce its reliance on other energy suppliers and enhance its energy security.
3. **Counter-Terrorism Cooperation:** Both India and Uzbekistan share concerns about terrorism and extremism emanating from regions like Afghanistan. Cooperation on security matters, intelligence sharing, and counter-terrorism initiatives is essential for maintaining regional stability. Uzbekistan's role in this regard strengthens India's security posture in the region.
4. **Economic Growth and Investment:** Uzbekistan's economic reforms and growing economy provide opportunities for Indian businesses and investors.  India can leverage its expertise in various sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure development to participate in Uzbekistan's economic growth, creating mutually beneficial partnerships.
5. **Cultural and Historical Ties:** India and Uzbekistan share a long history of cultural and economic ties, dating back to the Silk Road era. These historical connections provide a strong foundation for bilateral relations, fostering people-to-people exchanges, and strengthening diplomatic ties.

In summary, Uzbekistan's strategic location, resources, shared security concerns, economic potential, and historical ties make it a vital partner for India in its pursuit of regional engagement and global interests.
